Put all of these files into your python directory. 
DO NOT TRY TO VIEW THE FILES. 
When in your directory you'll want to install all packages by going to your terminal and inputting "python InstallDeps.py" (Don't mind any errors, it's fine)
After they finish installing you need to input "python KronOS.py" to open the operating system.
When ready to complete the puzzle, quit the application and input "python EP.py" into your terminal.

If you have trouble, report to me.
